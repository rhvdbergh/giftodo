# Giftodo: A React Native ToDo using Gifs

## Description

_Duration: Three days_

Giftodo is a todo app for those who remember gifs better than words. Users can add new tasks (similar to most todo apps) with a name, description, priority, and due date and time. The twist lies therein that the user can also then add a randomly generated gif based on the name of the task. Users can click the generate button until they find a gif that they are satisfied with.

The bottom navigation bar allows users to navigate between four different views: a list of tasks, a list of tasks with gifs assigned to them (and this list displays each gif), the add task view (which becomes the edit task view when a user wants to edit a task), and the dedicated overdue view where users can immediately see which tasks are overdue.

All task lists can be sorted with a speed dial, and the sort can by ordered by priority, name, due date, and date added. Clicking the sort button again reverses the sort order.

I built this app in about three days during a Christmas holiday break. (Yes, I took some time off for the holidays too! Always a good thing to get some rest). The main reason for building this app was to explore working with React Native. (At the moment, the app was only tested on iPhone devices.)

The app uses a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database to on the back end, [Express](https://expressjs.com/) / [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as a server, and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) with [React Native Elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/) as a styling library on the front end. The app was initiated and run through [Expo](https://expo.dev/) to allow testing on a simulator and on a native device. Gifs are generated by integration with the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/).

## Installation

1. After cloning this repository, set up a PostgreSQL database called `react_native_todo` on port 5432. You might want to use [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) as a GUI to help this setup process.
2. Use the commands in the `database.sql` file in the root directory of the project to set up the table in the database with some dummy data.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies in this project.
4. To use the Giphy API, you will have to be set up a Giphy API key, which can be done [here, on the Giphy Developers page](https://developers.giphy.com/).
5. In the root directory of the project, set up a file called `config.js` and in this file add only the following lines, where the text in quotation marks should appear without quotation marks, but be the LOCALHOST ip address (e.g., 192.168.0.2) for the current computer and the Giphy API key generated on the Giphy Developers page in the previous step. Note that this localhost ip is not 127.0.0.1 but the external ip for the local host, because the phone / simulator has to connect to the local host computer (and not itself). The `config.js` file should be in the root directory; make sure that the `.gitignore` file includes a reference to this file (which it should if not altered) so as not to expose your api key should you upload to GitHub.

```
export const LOCALHOST_IP = 'ip_here';
export const GIPHY_API = 'giphy_api_key_here';
```

6. Run `npm server start` to start the server, which will run on port 5000.
7. Run `expo start` to start expo. Follow the instructions in the terminal to run the app on your phone or on a simulator on your computer. (Pressing `i` should open the app in the simulator.)On a Mac, [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) should be installed to use the simulator.

## Acknowledgement

This app was built while I was studying at [Prime Digital Academy](www.primeacademy.io) during the Christmas break. The instruction I received there—and the general mindset of exploration—was very useful in building this app.
